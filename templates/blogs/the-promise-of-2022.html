<h1>Happy New Year!</h1>
<h3>Last year was¬† difficult for me, it entailed so many changes that keeping up was a challenge. But with the help of thoughtful and empathetic friends and family, I have adjusted to my new life.</h3>
<p>This blog has been around for some time, but I am sad to say that it was thoroughly neglected. I was unable to find the time to write in my new routine, and when I did unearth some pocket of freedom - I would fidget with minutiae rather than focus on the essential. There are plenty of reasons for this, ranging from a general fear of commitment to <em>‚Äúdevelop the entire blog correctly, then you won‚Äôt ever have to revisit your code‚Äù aka <strong>S.A.D.G.I.L.E.</strong></em> </p>
<p>Alas, inertia is a dangerous thing - and when allowed to fester, the smallest step can feel like upheaval. I have mustered the will to write this post, and I hope it will be the first of many to come. It is not as much a resolution as it is a convenient point to start. I am well settled, and have interesting things to talk about from my interactions with peers and professors at CU Boulder. </p>
<p>I am also setting myself up for success. You see, I had a bad process before - I would work on an MVP basis, for each release of this blog. This is a good idea if you are a team with clients who demand custom deliverables. But there are 3 crucial places where my individual experiments differ from this - </p>
<ul>
<li>I am eking out time from a busy schedule to build passion projects that are supposed to generate a chuckle or a <em>‚Äúthat‚Äôs pretty cool, huh‚Äù</em> and nothing more. If I don‚Äôt implement a rich feature-set, there is no shortfall in anyone‚Äôs life. I don‚Äôt need to worry about some shitty CSS interaction (honestly, all CSS interactions are shitty IMO) when I am trying to build a Concordance Engine for example. Perfection is the enemy of done.</li>
<li>All these passion projects have one key component that ties them together, a deployment with a view - which will either have Nginx + Django Rest Framework + VueJS or Nginx + Django as the basis. In fact, I feel the view is the most important thing that Data Scientists don‚Äôt seem to be bothered about (a blog post topic in the near future, for sure!). So I am going to standardize my stack and keep the Docker container ready - I can then worry about a single main feature when implementing my projects - which I hope will speed up my time.</li>
<li>Ideas, inspiration and leisure come at random. <strong>Do what you can in the moment and publish that.</strong> A half finished feature is better than no feature. An incomplete Story release could be a problem, but you are not working on a Story - you are having fun, albeit constructively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, and possibly most important of all - I am going to try and rope in my friends to take a look at my posts. They are a geeky bunch, and some of them are accomplished bloggers (<a href="https://binnyva.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=substack_profile">check out Binny‚Äôs MindOS</a> ). They will have something to say, and that will urge me on - it will feel like this blog matters. As an extroverted, social person - I feel this will add a lot of weight to the maintenance of this blog. </p>
<p>So this is wishing you a new year, and hopefully you see more of this to come. See you soon, and keep your fingers crossed ü§û!</p>
